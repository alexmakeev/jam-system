## Market Trends

### 2024-2025 Developments
- Microsoft's official entry in March 2025 marked significant adoption
- Anthropic's reference implementation shows strong community adoption (549K+ downloads)
- Growing ecosystem with specialized servers for different use cases
- Shift toward accessibility-tree based automation for reliability

### Community Growth
- Active development across multiple programming languages
- Specialization into different automation niches (scraping, testing, cloud)
- Integration with AI/LLM workflows becoming standard

## Technical Architecture Patterns

### Accessibility Tree Approach (Microsoft)
- Structured, text-based webpage representation
- More reliable than pixel-based automation
- Language-agnostic interaction model

### Traditional WebDriver Approach (Puppeteer)
- Direct browser API interaction
- Pixel-based element targeting
- Established automation patterns

### Hybrid Approaches (Community)
- Combination of multiple automation strategies
- Specialized for specific use cases
- Often built on top of existing frameworks
